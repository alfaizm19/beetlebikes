            <p><strong>Beetle Bikes</strong> make super safe little bikes to power kids.</p>
            <p>We’re parents ourselves and also happen to be Cycling enthusiasts. With over 50,000 km of cycling between both founders, we understand the needs of a rider very well!</p>
            <p>We decided to use our Engineering and Management qualifications to good use and created a brand that we would be confident to buy for our kids too.</p>
            <p>We’re focused on sharing our love for riding with the next generation. If you want your child to steer away from a screen and onto a trail, here's your bike to do it.</p>
            <p>The bicycle is an empowering tool, especially for kids. Toddlers learn like sponges just by riding with you. You become more than just their parent, you’re their trusted, guiding ride buddy!</p>
            <p>Early and middle grade schoolers develop balance, self-confidence and physical fitness on their bikes, all at their own pace. They learn their way around their neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>By the time kids are rocking a Scout 26” down the trail, they’re skilled, independent explorers. All from their bike.</p>

                    <p class="team-text">Himanshu is into road biking and changed gears as he traded his love for super bikes for road biking. Personal cycling performance is what drives him, and he loves to race in the virtual cycling arena on his Merida Reacto DL. He will soon be reaching the 15,000km mark and the one ride that truly tested him was the gruelling Tour of Nilgirs. An alumnus of SCMHRD, Pune, Himanshu has worked across multiple corporate roles over his 18 year professional career.</p>
